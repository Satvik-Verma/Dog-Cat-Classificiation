# Dog-Cat-Classificiation
workshop for ai club 2023 


I'm not adding the dataset in here but I will be providing a link for it through which you all can download it if you don't already have it.

You don't have to use my model.h5 or my X.pkl or Y.pkl, when you run the code it will be created automatically.

just download the train.zip file and segregate the data into 2 folders named, cat and dog.
